# Pocket Stock
## Inspiration 
The project was inspired by my friends who have worked for a little bit and have money saved up.
Everyone became interested in getting rich through investing and as a result, constantly chat about the potential of stocks to go up as well as down. To avoid getting asked any more question about the prospect of a stock, i have created this project to let them collect their own market data and a report generation system that will let them decide for themselves.

## Data Input
The data will be stock prices. This project will be using selenium with chrome driver to scrape stock price. when starting the scrapper, the user will give a file with names of stock tickers they want to keep data as well as frequency. Selenium will then proceed to scrape data until the program is terminated. The chrome window that selenium will open is hidden by configuration within code but please keep in mind it will take up memory in cases where users computer is slow.
## Mock Data
This folder contain a list of all current nasdaq tickers to help you get started. It also contain a simple algorithms in case you want to test the report generation program before you start collecting your own data. The algorithm currently determines price by  randomly randomly rate of increase/decreas percentage with relation to previous time interval. I am thinking about doing it by monte carlo simulation along with geometric brownian motion but it might be quite calculation intensive for such a trivial task.

## Data Storage
I will be using postgreSQL for this project due to the focus of this project. Because the project is meant to be a data gathering/report generation tool, i do not see the need for any SQL database. In the case where users want to scale the system. postgreSQL's master-slave structure is perfectly fine with simple writing and querying without the need for fast performance. This database will be accessed by the selenium scrapper to write and the report generation for data query. 

## Report Generation
This file will generate a pdf file containing plots and statistics of the date range and stock that is given. Transformations will be made by use of pandas library in python and all the charts will be generated by matlibplot library. Sample outputs are given below. As of right now, the reports will be generating mostly line graph and bar graphs. A sample of graphs is shown below. The data used was generated by algorithm in mock_data folder.

## Conclusion
This is my short and simple project in attempt to solve a simple problem. Please lay back and let the machines do all the hard work. And remember, diversification is key and betting of short term gains is basically gambling. :) 


## Future Work 
More work is needed in terms of additional statistics in graphs as well as code refactoring. I am also working on trying automate everything with bash scripts.
